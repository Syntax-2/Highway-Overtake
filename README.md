## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

| Feature                        | Implementation & Purpose                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Singleton Manager Architecture** | Persistent managers (`GameDataManager`, `PlayerCarManager`) handle global game state, ensuring data persists across scene loads. |
| **ScriptableObject-Driven Design** | Decouples game data (cars, maps, upgrades) from logic for easy scalability and content management.           |
| **Event-Driven Systems**            | Uses C# events (`Action<T>`) for clean communication between managers and UI, avoiding tight dependencies.  |
| **Procedural Content**              | Spawner scripts dynamically generate the endless level for infinite replayability.                          |
| **Dynamic UI Management**           | Persistent `CameraAndMenuManager` handles complex UI/camera transitions and remembers views between scenes. |
| **URP & Post-Processing**           | Universal Render Pipeline for optimized graphics and dynamic Volume system for effects.                     |
